				<h1>What is family violence?</h1>

				<p>Family violence is when someone behaves violently to another family member.</p>
				<p>It may be experienced within families, marriages, de facto relationships and lesbian relationships. It may be inflicted on adults and children or it may be between siblings or extended family members.</p>

				<h1>How to prevent family violence</h1>
				<p>Family violence is complex and each experience is difference.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>From international evidence that the major cause is inequality between women and men â€“ that is, the unequal distribution of power, resources and opportunities</li> 
					<li>Stereotypical ideas about the roles of women and men in society and the way they should behave, fosters an environment for violence against women to occur</li>
					<li>In individual relationships, this inequality plays out in the belief that a man is entitled to exercise power and control over his partner and children</li>
