					<p>Partnerships with business or organisations are a crucial area of support for Kara House. By Funding programs, hosting fundraising events, getting involved in workplace giving, donating goods in-kind, or supporting us in a myriad of other ways, partnerships enable us to help improve the lives of women and children escaping family violence.</p>
					
					<p>If you would like to support our work, here are some ways your organisation or business can help:</p>
					
					<ul>
					  <li><b>Fund one of our program areas</b> - Improvements to our refuge, support services or programs by supplying much needed items</li>
					  <li><b>Provide pro-bono support</b> - Volunteer your professional skills</li>
					  <li><b>Host a fundraising event</b> - Organise an event within your workplace or community</li>
					  <li><b>Workplace giving programs</b> - Workplace giving enables employees to make a regular donation to the charity of their choice with an automatic deduction of a set amount from their earnings</li>
					  <li><b>Material Aid donations</b> - You can give Material Aid donations</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>These are just some of the forms of support that partnership can take. Weâ€™d love to talk to you about how your business or organisation can get involved and partner with Kara House.</p>
